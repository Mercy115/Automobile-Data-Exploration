# Automobile-Data-Exploration
Automobile Data Exploration using Python
Project Overview
This project is a beginner-level data analytics project developed during an internship.
The main objective is to understand how to explore datasets and extract meaningful insights using Python.
The project performs data cleaning, analysis, and visualization on an automobile dataset to answer business-related questions.

Objectives:
Import the automobile dataset using Python Pandas.
Identify missing values and remove incomplete records.
Perform analysis to answer the following:
Find cars with minimum and maximum price
Count cars based on body style
Calculate average price of cars for each body type
Calculate average price of cars for each company
Count cars with different number of cylinders
Visualize relationships between different automobile features.

Dataset
The dataset contains automobile specifications such as:
Company
Price
Body style
Engine type
Number of cylinders
Horsepower

Technologies Used:
Python
Pandas
Matplotlib
Jupyter Notebook

Project Workflow:
1. Data Loading:
The dataset is loaded directly from the online CSV file using Pandas.
2. Data Cleaning:
Checked for null values
Removed rows containing missing values
3. Data Analysis
The following analyses were performed:
Maximum and minimum priced cars
Distribution of body styles
Average price per body type
Average price per company
Cylinder count distribution
4. Data Visualization
Visualizations were created to explore relationships between:
Company vs Price
Company vs Cylinders
Body Type vs Price
Body Type vs Cylinders
Engine Type vs Horsepower

Key Learnings:
Data cleaning using Pandas
Handling missing values
Grouping and aggregation operations
Basic exploratory data analysis
Data visualization using Matplotlib
